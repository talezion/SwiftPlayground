## Overview

This repo is intended for educators and developers alike. It provides rich, hands-on examples covering a wide range of Swift topics, including:

- Basic syntax and string interpolation
- Arithmetic operations and operator overloading
- Advanced collection operations with arrays, dictionaries, and sets
- Control flow mechanisms like conditionals, loops, and switches
- Function definitions with various parameter types and return values
- Extensive coverage of closures, including callbacks and asynchronous usage
- Working with enums, structs, and classes to build data models
- Property observers and computed properties
- Methods, subscripts, inheritance, and initialization/deinitialization
- Error handling with custom error types
- Swift’s new concurrency model with async/await
- Type casting, nested types, extensions, protocols, and generics
- Advanced topics like opaque types, ARC, and access control

Each section is self-contained and includes comprehensive examples to help you run, modify, and experiment with the code during your live session.

## Slides and Code Examples

Below is an overview of each slide. You can find the corresponding code in this repo.

### Slide 1: The Basics of Swift
- Introduces constants (let) and variables (var), string interpolation, and basic printing.

### Slide 2: Basic Operators
- Demonstrates arithmetic operators and custom operator overloading.

### Slide 3: Strings and Characters
- Covers string manipulations like uppercase/lowercase conversion, concatenation, and character counting.

### Slide 4: Collection Types
- Explores arrays, dictionaries, and sets with operations like sorting, filtering, and union/intersection.

### Slide 5: Control Flow
- Showcases conditionals, loops, and switch statements to manage execution flow.

### Slide 6: Functions
- Covers function declarations, external parameter names, default parameters, variadic functions, and tuple returns.

### Slide 7: Closures
- Demonstrates using closures with sorted, filter, map, and asynchronous callbacks with @Sendable annotations.

### Slide 8: Enumerations
- Explains enums with raw values, associated values, and computed properties.

### Slide 9: Structures and Classes
- Compares value types (structs) and reference types (classes) and demonstrates their behavior differences.

### Slide 10: Properties
- Covers stored, computed properties and property observers (didSet).

### Slide 11: Methods
- Demonstrates instance methods, as well as static methods.

### Slide 12: Subscripts
- Explains read-only and read-write subscripts for custom data access.

### Slide 13: Inheritance
- Shows class inheritance with method overriding.

### Slide 14: Initialization
- Demonstrates failable initializers and convenience initializers.

### Slide 15: Deinitialization
- Explains how deinitializers are used to clean up resources.

### Slide 16: Optional Chaining
- Demonstrates safe access to nested optionals using optional chaining.

### Slide 17: Error Handling
- Covers throwing and catching custom errors using do-try-catch blocks.

### Slide 18: Swift Concurrency Basics
- Demonstrates async/await, running asynchronous tasks, and concurrent execution.

### Slide 21: Type Casting
- Explains safe downcasting using as? and type checking with is.

### Slide 22: Nested Types
- Shows how to organize code with nested enums, structs, and classes.

### Slide 23: Extensions
- Demonstrates extending built-in types with additional methods and computed properties.

### Slide 24: Protocols & Protocol Extensions
- Covers defining protocols, providing default implementations, and conforming to protocols.

### Slide 25: Generics
- Provides examples of generic functions and generic types.

### Slide 25A: Protocol Generics with Associated Types
- Demonstrates protocols with associated types to create flexible, type-safe interfaces.

### Slide 26: Opaque and Boxed Protocol Types
